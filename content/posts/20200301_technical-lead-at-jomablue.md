Worked closely with the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and acted as a point of contact for advice and guidance on technology matters.

Led and managed a team of Developers at varying levels of experience; managed staff onboarding processes, provided clear objectives, and facilitated training and mentoring tailored to individual needs.

Ensured the team could work efficiently on the product by running daily stand-up meetings, assessing bug reports, scoping out new feature requests, testing code changes, and building releases.
