I recently visited New York to see how [Ella](https://twitter.com/ellacondon) was going with her studies there. I had some vague plans _(who wants to overplan a holiday anyway)_ of what to see and do when I was there. This was the first time I'd visited New York and also the USA, so I had a few challenges along the way. However, these certainly weren't to do the people I met over there, who were all kind and helpful but somewhat louder than I expected.

I was welcomed in to the country by a very friendly airport employee at [LAX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_International_Airport) and experienced some snow on the way in to [JFK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_International_Airport) which was pretty magical. Getting to the city via the shuttle late at night in decent levels of snow was also beautiful.

Naturally, first on my list was a recommendation from [Brett](https://twitter.com/theromulans) to visit a specific diner where he'd enjoyed a fine burger in the past. Specifically, this diner was named [J.G. Melon](http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/3/30459/restaurant/Upper-East-Side/J-G-Melon-New-York), and it was certainly worth the trek. I ordered a Bacon Cheeseburger ($10.50). It was a tantalising mix of meat and cheese, perfected with a side of cottage fried potatoes. This was the first and best burger of my trip.

As a huge fan of the [Seinfeld](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) series, I just had to visit the diner that they used for external shots in the early series. [Tom's Restaurant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom's_Restaurant) is located in the upper west side of the city and has become a bit of a tourist destination. Obviously, we had to see what the food was like. It wasn't very exciting really, but they still managed a decent American burger for a fair price!

Aside from the cheap food, there are also some pretty spectacular views in this city. One of the most surprising to me was [Grand Central](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Central_Terminal) terminal, which certainly lives up to it's name.

[Coney Island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coney_Island) was also a favourite of mine. After receiving a fair amount of damage from [Hurricane Sandy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Sandy), Coney Island feels almost like a ghost town.

Another location with some awesome views is [Central Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park), which acts as an escape from the busy city for the locals and tourists alike.

I'd love to return to this beautiful city in the near future, I might even plan it out a little more!
