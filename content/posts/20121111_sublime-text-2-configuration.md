[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) is a heavily customisable text editor designed for programmers. It has a free trial, and can be [purchased for $59](http://www.sublimetext.com/buy). There is some competition in this area; [Coda](http://panic.com/coda), [Espresso](http://macrabbit.com/espresso/) and [Visual Studio](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-overview) are a few that come to mind.

However, I'm a big fan of customising a tool to meet my specific needs, so I thought I'd share my current Sublime Text 2 configuration:

- [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) - Simplify the installation and management of plugins
- [Sublime <span class="caps">SFTP</span>](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/sftp) - A feature rich <span class="caps">FTP</span> plugin (free trial, $16)
- [Soda theme](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme/) - Improve the look of the interface, includes light and dark variations<li>[Droid Sans Mono](http://damieng.com/blog/2007/11/14/droid-sans-mono-great-coding-font) - Font suitable for programming
- [RailsCasts colour scheme](http://railscasts.com/about) - Light on dark colour scheme
- [Customised preferences](https://github.com/bmurty/dotfiles/tree/main/sublime-text) - My customisations including disabling autocomplete and code folding
</ul>

### Update (6 Feb 2013)

I'm now using the [Revelation](https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes#revelation) colour scheme by [Dayle Rees](https://github.com/daylerees) and changed the font to Consolas (18, gray_antialias, no_bold).

### Update (15 Jan 2014)

I'm now sharing my [Sublime Text 3 preferences](https://github.com/bmurty/dotfiles/tree/64c37fc7c0c04552a4fcade931237e12af1fd9d3/sublime-text) on GitHub! Feel free to have a look at my current setup.
