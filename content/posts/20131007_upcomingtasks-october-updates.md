I've been a little light on **UpcomingTasks** updates over the last few months. I hope these recent updates are worth the wait!

#### User box

UpcomingTasks now displays your basic Basecamp 2 user details on the bottom of the menu. Press it to quickly logout.

#### Other updates

- Bug fix: Removed task location dropdown when editing tasks due to a [limitation with the Basecamp 2 API](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/37signals-api/izva7VKx0LQ)
- Back-end: Added new testing methods to allow for quicker updates in the future
- Performance: Removed previous Basecamp 2 user details access method
- Performance: Improved database queries for the authentication process, resulting in much quicker page load times
- Design: Task detail text tweaked to give more focus to the task name
