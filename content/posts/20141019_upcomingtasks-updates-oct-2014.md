I've made a few updates to UpcomingTasks over the last month, here's a quick rundown on what's changed.

#### Improved support for small accounts

If your account only has one project, UpcomingTasks will now tweak some features to improve the experience. A new _Project_ link in the menu takes you directly to your project and the name of the project will no longer crowd up your task lists.

#### A more welcoming home page

The page that is shown to users before they login has been updated to describe some key features and showcase them in new screenshots.

#### Add to Home Screen updates

The Add to Home Screen page has also been simplified following updates to the Windows Phone pin method.

#### View the code!

Just in case you missed it, [UpcomingTasks is now open source](https://github.com/bmurty/upcomingtasks)! While no user data will ever be shared, everyone can now peek under the hood and see how the whole system works.
