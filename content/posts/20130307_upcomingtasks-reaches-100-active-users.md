I'm very proud of my humble little web app, **UpcomingTasks**, as it's just reached 100 active users.

Born out of my own frustrations with the lack of a suitable Basecamp 2 client for [Windows Phone](http://www.windowsphone.com/), UpcomingTasks is and always will earn it's place high on [my homescreen](/images/brendan/homescreen.png), no matter what device I'm currently using.

Hope you enjoy using it as much as I do! Haven't given it a go yet? All you need is a [Basecamp 2](http://basecamp.com/2) account.

I'll continue to refine features and fix bugs as I come across them, but if you've got any ideas, or notice something that isn't quite right, feel free to [send me an email](brendan@murty.au).
