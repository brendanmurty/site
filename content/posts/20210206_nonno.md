My Nonno, Adelchi "Alec" Infanti, passed away recently after an accomplished 98 year life.

He always prioritised family and was generous with his time.
He loved sharing stories, chatting about our lives and teaching us how to cook.

After making the long trip over from Italy to Australia with his wife, my Nonna, he supported his growing family with a steady job working with explosives at the local quarry.

He worked there for 30 years. It was physically exhausting work and he lost parts of his fingers in accidents but I never heard any complaints from him.

He taught me to be thankful, supportive and resilient in both my working and family lives.

Arrivederci Nonno.
