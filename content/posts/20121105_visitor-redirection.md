Redirecting a user consistently can be a challenging in a complex website, as you can't be sure which method (JavaScript or the [HTTP location header](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_location)) is most suitable. This can be handled with a rather simple PHP function:

    <?php
    function redirect($url){
    	if(headers_sent()){
    		print '<script>window.location="'.$url.'"</script>';
    	}else{
    		header('Location: '.$url);
    	}
    	exit();
    }
    ?>
