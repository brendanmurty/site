[UpcomingTasks](http://upcomingtasks.com) has received some interface updates today, the most obvious of which is the new menu, which uses vertical space more effectively than the previous design. Just press on the page title to toggle the menu.

*The new menu in it's open state*

Also, as it's where you actually get work done, the task page has also been updated. Modify the task using the new contextual menu shown below the task's title.
